# Horizontal Rules

## Overview
Horizontal rules create visual separators in your markdown documents.

## Syntax
Use three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores:

```markdown
---
***
___
```

## Examples

This is content above the rule.

---

This is content below the rule.

***

Another rule with asterisks.

___

And another with underscores.

## Best Practices
- Use horizontal rules to separate major sections
- Don't overuse them - they should provide meaningful breaks
- Be consistent with your rule style
- Ensure there's a blank line before and after the rule
- Use them to improve document readability and structure
