# Escaping Characters

## Overview

Sometimes you need to display characters that have special meaning in markdown. Escaping allows you to show these characters as literal text.

## Basic Escaping

Use a backslash `\` before the character you want to escape:

```markdown
\*This text will show asterisks\*
\`This will show backticks\`
\[This will show brackets\]
```

## Common Characters to Escape

| Character | Escaped | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `*` | `\*` | Asterisk |
| `_` | `\_` | Underscore |
| `` ` `` | `` \` `` | Backtick |
| `[` | `\[` | Opening bracket |
| `]` | `\]` | Closing bracket |
| `(` | `\(` | Opening parenthesis |
| `)` | `\)` | Closing parenthesis |
| `#` | `\#` | Hash |
| `+` | `\+` | Plus |
| `-` | `\-` | Hyphen |
| `.` | `\.` | Period |
| `!` | `\!` | Exclamation mark |

## Examples

### Escaping Asterisks

```markdown
\*This is not italic\*
```

### Escaping Backticks

```markdown
\`This is not inline code\`
```

### Escaping Brackets

```markdown
\[This is not a link\](url)
```

### Escaping Hash

```markdown
\# This is not a heading
```

## Best Practices

- Only escape characters when necessary
- Be consistent with your escaping style
- Test your markdown to ensure proper rendering
- Consider using code blocks for complex examples
- Remember that some characters don't need escaping in all contexts
