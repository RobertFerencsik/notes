# Line Breaks

## Overview

Line breaks control how text flows and is displayed in markdown documents.

## Syntax

There are two ways to create line breaks:

### Method 1: Two spaces at end of line

```markdown
This line ends with two spaces  
This line will be on a new line
```

### Method 2: HTML break tag

```markdown
This line ends with a break tag<br>
This line will be on a new line
```

## Examples

This line ends with two spaces  
This line will be on a new line

This line ends with a break tag<br>
This line will be on a new line

## Best Practices

- Use two spaces for simple line breaks within paragraphs
- Use blank lines to separate paragraphs
- Use HTML `<br>` tags sparingly
- Be consistent with your line break style
