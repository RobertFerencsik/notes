# Blockquotes

## Overview
Blockquotes are used to highlight quoted text or create visual emphasis for important information.

## Syntax
Use `>` at the beginning of each line:

```markdown
> This is a blockquote
```

For multi-line blockquotes:
```markdown
> This is a multi-line blockquote.
> Each line starts with a `>` symbol.
```

## Examples

> This is a simple blockquote.

> This is a multi-line blockquote.
> It can span multiple lines.
> Each line starts with the `>` symbol.

## Nested Blockquotes
```markdown
> First level
>> Second level
>>> Third level
```

> First level
>> Second level
>>> Third level

## Best Practices
- Use blockquotes for actual quotes from other sources
- Use them to highlight important information
- Keep blockquotes concise and relevant
- Don't overuse them - they should stand out
- Consider using them for callouts or warnings
