# Blockquotes

## Overview

Blockquotes are used to highlight quoted text or create visual emphasis for important information.

## Syntax

Use `>` at the beginning of each line:

```markdown
> This is a blockquote
```

For multi-line blockquotes:
```markdown
> This is a multi-line blockquote.
> Each line starts with a `>` symbol.
```

## Examples

> This is a simple blockquote.

> This is a multi-line blockquote.
> It can span multiple lines.
> Each line starts with the `>` symbol.

## Nested Blockquotes

```markdown
> First level
>> Second level
>>> Third level
```

> First level
>> Second level
>>> Third level

## Best Practices

- Use blockquotes for actual quotes from other sources
- Use them to highlight important information
- Keep blockquotes concise and relevant
- Don't overuse them - they should stand out
- Consider using them for callouts or warnings

## Attribution Best Practices

- Always include the author's name
- Use an em dash (—) to separate quote from attribution
- Include additional context when relevant (title, year, profession)
- Keep attribution on a separate line for clarity
- Use italics for book titles, article names, or works
- Be consistent with your attribution style throughout the document
