# Paragraphs

## Overview

Paragraphs are the basic building blocks of text content in markdown.

## Syntax

Simply write text separated by blank lines:

```markdown
This is the first paragraph.

This is the second paragraph.
```

## Examples

This is a paragraph of text. It can contain multiple sentences and will be rendered as a single block of text.

This is another paragraph. It's separated from the first paragraph by a blank line.

## Best Practices

- Separate paragraphs with blank lines
- Keep paragraphs focused on a single idea
- Use appropriate paragraph length (3-5 sentences typically)
- Don't use HTML `<br>` tags for line breaks within paragraphs
