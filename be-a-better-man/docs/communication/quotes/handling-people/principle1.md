# Don't criticize, condemn or complain

> I learned thirty years ago that it is foolish to scold. I have enough trouble overcoming my own limitations without fretting over the fact that God has not seen fit to distribute evenly the gift of intelligence.

>> John Wanamaker

Criticism is dangerous, becaus it wounds a person's precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.

> As much as we thirst for approval, we dread condemnation.

>> Hans Selye

The resentment that criticism engender can demoralize employees, family members and friends, and still not correct the situation that has been condemned.

Let's realize that criticisms are like homing pigeons. They always return home.

> Judge not, that ye be not judged.

>> Matthew 7:1

Lincoln's reply when others spoke harshly of the southern people:

"Don't criticize them; they are just what we would be under similar circumstances."

> Don't complain about the snow on your neighbor's roof, when your own doorstep is unclean
>
>> Confucius

Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain, and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.
