# Planning Code Projects

This short documentation is a *guide for planning projects*. These steps are not designed to encourage you to make a perfect documentation before you start coding, but to walk you through the different important steps you need to think through *before you jump into building*.

In every step you need to answer the questions. Feel free to write it down on a piece of paper.

## 1. The Goal

- Why am I making this project?
- Who is this project for?
- What is gonna make it valuable?

## 2. User Stories

- What can a user do with this project?
- (Write down 10 to 20 scenarios)

## 3. Define Data Models

- What types of information do I have to store?
- What are the connections between them?
- How can I store them?

## 4. Nail An MVP

- What can I remove from steps 1 to 3?
- What is the smallest possible idea that I can make out of it (extend later)?

## 5. Draw Stupid Simple Prototype

- Draw a very basic wireframe (no figma and fancy stuff at this point).
- How is the basic flow and layer output will work?

## 6. Understand The Future Of The Project

- Is this a hobby project? A product for a small community? Maybe for a growing community?
- Does it has to be scalable?

## 7. Drill Into The Components

- How the architecture of this project looks like?
- Is it a simple scrip or i need API's, frontend interfaces web services, packages, a storage solution?

## 8. Pick My Stack

- What tools can I use to make this work?
- What are the simples tools that i know how to use (or want to learn)?
- (Pick out frontend, backend , database and framework in this step)

## 9. Overall Development Process

- Coding (small bits of it and test it right away)
- Project skeleton

    1. Basic folder structure
    2. Development environments
    3. Version control

- Setting up the database and creating data models
- Backend routes

    1. API endpoints

- Frontend interface

    1. Connect to backend

- Project iteration

    1. Add features
    2. Test
    3. Deploy early and often

- Automated deployment and testing
